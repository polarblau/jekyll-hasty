## WARNING!

This first version of jekyll-hasty [monkeyâ€“patches](https://github.com/polarblau/jekyll-hasty/blob/master/lib/jekyll/post.rb) `Jekyll::Post` by
overriding/extending `#to_liquid`. It is definitely a goal to solve this
otherwise in the future, either by forking Jekyll, suggesting the
extension to original project or some other way.
